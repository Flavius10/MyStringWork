# Mini Projects from Spring Framework Study
These mini-projects were developed as part of my ongoing study of the Spring Framework in Java. The projects are based on exercises and examples from a book I am studying, which cover various aspects of Spring development, including dependency injection, web development, data access, and application context configuration.

Each mini-project focuses on a different concept of the Spring ecosystem, allowing me to build practical skills and a deeper understanding of how to create scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications using Spring.

Key areas covered in the mini-projects include:

    Spring Core: Implementing basic applications using dependency injection and beans management.

    Spring MVC: Developing simple web applications using Spring's Model-View-Controller architecture.

    Spring Data: Integrating databases and using Spring's data access features to interact with relational data sources.

    Spring Boot: Simplifying application setup and configuration using Spring Boot to create stand-alone, production-ready applications.

These projects have provided me with hands-on experience in Java Spring development and helped me gain confidence in using this powerful framework for enterprise-level applications.
